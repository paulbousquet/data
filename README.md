# Real Rates
* umich.csv shows the percent adjustment to the inflation rate based on the month over month percent change in annualized inflation expectations. When applied to a usuaul inflation rate (I use CPI) this creates a proxy for inflation expectatations.
    * this adjustment is because this survey has high central tendencies, in part due to survey respondants only reporting integer expectations 
    * Many studies use the survey of professional forecasters, but for settings in which we are trying to understand movements along a consumer dimension, this seems more appropriate 
    * The Fed's survey of consumer expectations has a better design but unfortunately did not begin until last decade (central tendencies are still too high anyway).
    * Using PCE does not match traditional estimates of real rates well 
* irates.csv shows various interest rates on, including real rates using the above method
