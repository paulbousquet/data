A description of some common series

* ns are news shocks from [Nakamura and Steinsson (2018)](https://www.acostamiguel.com/). target and path are from [Gürkaynak, Sack and Swanson (2005)](https://www.ijcb.org/journal/ijcb05q2a2.pdf), where target denotes changes to current fed funds target and path are changes to the expected path of FFR over the next year
  * Both "have been scaled to have unit standard deviation and a positive correlation with the one-day change in the one-year treasury yield around the FOMC announcement"
  * Both are dependent on structural estimation (i.e., when the sample changes, the estimates change. a feature not a bug)
* ff.shock.0 is the 30 minute change in the expected (effective) funds rate
  * reported in percentage point terms (1 basis point => .01)
* rr are the updated [Romer and Romer (2004)](https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/0002828042002651) narrative shocks
  * Miguel Acosta has created a [GH repository](https://github.com/miguel-acosta/RomerRomer2004) showing his code for generating the data via scraping the Fed's website
* from [Jarociński and Karadi (2020)](https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/mac.20180090)
* u1-u4 is the Fed's "unconventional policy shocks" from [Jarociński (2024)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304393224000011?via%3Dihub)

* Helpful excel formula for matching shocks to full calendar `=SUMIFS(B:B, A:A, ">=" & E2, A:A, "<" & EOMONTH(E2, 0) + 1)`
